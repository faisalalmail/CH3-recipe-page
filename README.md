### What I learned
I have to say: **This was not an easy one**
On the surface, its an easy project! yes if you were used to webdev and know the best practices, but I am not. 

I created the basic elements of the project in a timely manner I thought I would finish it in one setting, but I later go into the little details of formatting lists and table which I didnt do in the previous challenges.

**I TRIED TO CHEAT**, I looked on frotendmentor for others solutions to figure out why my list text wouldn't indent properly or why the table flows out of the page in a webview, and what I found could not help me solve the issues I had.

Everyone has a different style of implementation, sometimes a little property that you apply could affect the whole result. **lesson leared**
